This code is a C++ program using the OpenGL library for rendering a simple 3D humanoid figure. The figure has movable joints and can perform animations based on user input. The code includes functions to create various body parts, set up a hierarchical structure for the humanoid figure, and perform inverse kinematics for animation.

Here is a brief overview of the code structure and key components:

Header Includes:

#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <GL/glut.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
Global Constants:
Various constants are defined for body part dimensions and joint angles.

Global Variables:

option: Used to control the animation option.
animation: Represents the current animation state.
done: Indicates whether the animation is complete.
rotate: Used for rotation of the figure.
horizontal: Used for horizontal movement.
Function Prototypes:
Prototypes for functions used to draw different body parts like head, torso, arms, legs, etc.

Data Structures:

point: A 3D point structure.
treenode: A structure representing a node in the hierarchical tree structure of the humanoid figure.
Global Variables (continued):

Various variables of type GLUquadricObj are declared for different body parts.
Theta Array:
An array theta is used to store initial joint angles.

Treenode Declarations:
Declarations for treenodes representing different body parts.

Drawing Functions:
Functions like torso(), head(), neck(), etc., are defined to draw the corresponding body parts.

Traverse Function:
traverse() function is defined to traverse the hierarchical tree and draw the entire humanoid figure.

Inverse Kinematics Functions:
inverseKinematics() function is defined to perform inverse kinematics for animation.

Display Function:
The display() function is called to display the figure.

Idle Function:
The idle() function is called during idle time and is responsible for animating the figure based on the selected option.

Menu Function:
The menu() function is called when a menu option is selected.

Reshape Function:
The myReshape() function is called when the window is reshaped.

Initialization Function:
The myinit() function is responsible for initializing OpenGL settings.

Main Function:
The main function initializes GLUT and enters the GLUT event loop.

This code provides a basic framework for a 3D humanoid figure with animation capabilities. The figure can perform predefined animations based on user input. The code uses OpenGL for rendering and GLUT for window management.
